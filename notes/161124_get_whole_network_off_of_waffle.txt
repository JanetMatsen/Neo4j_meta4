What I learned earlier:
- data.pkl has:
  -
- network.py:
  -
- network.R:


Actually, wait on that until I talk to Dave.

Shorter term goals:
- write a Python script that runs my Java Jar & collects results & makes plots
- run my Jar on waffle (wait until my whole network worth of data is ready)
- get the edges labeled for whether they are cross-species
- iterate over all the cross-species edges and record if they are part of a
  connected component

- Pros and Cons of using Neo4j
- Alternatives I could have chosen
  - Myria
- Loading data
  - image of a sub-network with node & edge properties.
- connected components:
  - not including singletons: not relevant to the biological questions
- results:
  - time for building network is ____(?nonlinear) with # of nodes
    - plot time vs cutoff, time vs # of nodes
  -
- Skills I gained
  - deciding what to do in which program framework:
    - describe connected components using Cypher, Java, or Python?
      - only do graphy stuff in Java
      - Cypher only for loading the database and visualizing.
      - can write Cypher queries to run from Java
- Recommendations moving forward
  - for large networks, use Myria (?)

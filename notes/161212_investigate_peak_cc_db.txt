- copied the database to its own dir since I tend to have problems with locking
- copied a copy of older Neo4j to that dir since it's not a big set of files
- how do I tell that Neo4j which db to load?
  - was in /Neo4j_meta4/pcor_0.0125/neo4j-community-2.3.2/conf/neo4j-server.properties
- launching:  `./bin/neo4j console`

=== Find cluster by component id ===

$MATCH (n) WHERE n.ConnectedComponents=43 RETURN n

$match (n) where n.gene_product =~ 'methanol dehydrogenase .*' RETURN n

match (n)<-->m where n.gene_product =~ '.* nitrogen.*' RETURN n
match (n)<-->(m) where n.gene_product =~ '.* nitrogen.*' RETURN n, m

# only 2 pairs of nodes:
MATCH (n)<- [e {cross_species:'True', association:'positive'}] -> (m) RETURN n, m


=== Styling ===
- currently edges are loaded as type X.
- instead use logic to give them types pos_pcor and neg_pcor
  - coloring of edges is done by edge type, not attribute.

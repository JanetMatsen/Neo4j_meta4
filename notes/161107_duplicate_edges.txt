- when I put the whole borken network in, I saw 2x as many edges as expected
- this doesn't happen with my 20 line CSV.  
- Also note that the browser is choking with 4k edges.
    " displaying 2?? nodes and 4??? edges
- investigate one minimally connected pair:
    - node 1 organism = Ga0081607.  Gnee = 111431
    - node2 = organism Ga0081607 (as well), and Gene = 10306
- write a query for those:
MATCH (n1 {gene:11431}) --> (n2 {gene:10306})
RETURN (n1) --> (n2)

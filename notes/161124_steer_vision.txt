Basic goals:
- learn how to do timing in Java.
- learn how to run my java script from the command line.

Goals with 2-organism sub-network:
- record the # of edges when only filtering on statistical significance cutoff
- vary edge weight magnitude cutoff:
  - run each query a few times to get avg and standard deviation. 
  - treat this as a pilot study for scaling to the whole dataset
    - can write on poster and in paper that Neo4j does not allow you to
      distribute a single query workload across servers.
  - one or two plots with:
    - # of connected components
    - time to determine the # of connected components

Transition to full network:
- load the Pickle and see how many edges there are
- on Waffle.
- does it fit on my computer?
- what are the distribution of edge weights?
- would running the whole pipeline on Waffle be a step toward AWS?
  - or a substitute for AWS?

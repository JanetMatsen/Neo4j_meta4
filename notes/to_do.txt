- develop understanding of Myria alternative.
- assess connectivity of network at given cutoff
  - number of edges per node
  - also do at the connected-components scale
- finalize python script:
  - Density of the graph: edges per node as f(threshold).
  - get time for query in addition to # of connected components.
- run my Jar on waffle (wait until my whole network worth of data is ready)
- make visualizations of sub-graphs in neo4j front end

- color by organism
  - can't color by property http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28859157/coloring-nodes-in-neo4j-depending-on-property
  - so prob need to have the node type be the organism
    - this is harder to write a general function for.
      - might need one cypher query per organism type.

=== Could do ===
- page-rank within clusters
  - What is the page rank winner within each connected component?

=== Probably won't do ===
- make a parallel PageRank

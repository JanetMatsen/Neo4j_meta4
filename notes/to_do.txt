- wipe the database at the beginning of every connected components script run.
- write a Python script that runs my Java Jar & collects results & makes plots
- finalize python script:
  - get time for query in addition to # of connected components.
- wipe the database before doing the database-loading script
  - is this going to take too long on the full network?  (Probably.)
- run my Jar on waffle (wait until my whole network worth of data is ready)
- get the edges labeled for whether they are cross-species
- iterate over all the cross-species edges and record if they are part of a
  connected component

- color by organism
  - can't color by property http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28859157/coloring-nodes-in-neo4j-depending-on-property
  - so prob need to have the node type be the organism
    - this is harder to write a general function for.
      - might need one cypher query per organism type.

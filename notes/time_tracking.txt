161215, 4, writiing, revising.  
161214, 2.5, writing
161213, 4, writing report.
161213, 5, heatmap of species in components.  Poster.
161212, 4, analyze connected components
161211, 3, fix time reporting and stdout parsing
161210, 5, run scripts on Waffle
161210, 4, make Python calls to build 50M networks work. New: Neo4j_meta4/code/database_comparisons.py
161209, 10, load newer network into Neo4j
161209, 2, add gene annotations to new network.
161206, 1, get larger network off of Waffle with Dave.
161202, 0.5, get data from Waffle
161201, 1, think about alternatives to Neo4j for connected components
161128, 1.66, making tsv summarising networks; starting to plot in python
161128, 4, try py2neo for iterating over nodes.  End up doing in Java.  Write CSV.
161128, 2, jars run on Waffle. Waffle has Java 8.
161127, 2.5, try running jars on Waffle
161127, 0.5 + , get scripts working after Git problem
161126, 2, refactor scripts + Git problem
161126, 1.25, refactor scripts
161125, 0.5, refactor scripts
161125 1.66, build db from shell commands line improvements
161124, 1.5, run java from Python (still work to do)
161124, 3, print algorithm time from command line, start preparing data for whole network
161119, 3.5, reduce network on edge magnitude and label cross-species edges
161118, 2, get Neo4jSNA running in Eclipse
161117, 4, get Neo4jSNA running in Eclipse
161117, 2, color nodes by organism, version 2
161117, 1, make a tsv with just the nodes in it
161116, 6, import newer data into Neo4j; not coloring by organism yet
161116, 4, cleaned up two-organism network data
161116, 2, literature review
161115, 4, try to run neo4j from Java rather than the app.  Oh, the jars!
161107, 0.5, duplicate edges on the larger network; not resolved.
161107, 3.5, got all of the nodes in the 20-line CSV in and did some coloring I can't automate
160611, 3.5, got a few nodes in.  See neo4j_test.
161106, 4, trying to load simple csv subset of data into neo4j using gitHub raw link
161105, 8, massaging data and trying to get it into neo4j
